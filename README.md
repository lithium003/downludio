# Downludio - Chrome Extension
Downludio is an audio downloader for https://www.udio.com/.  
Since Udio disabled downloads on 30/10/2025, there is no way to download your creations on the site itself. This Chrome extension allows you to do so.
This extension should work in any Chromium browser (Google Chrome, Micrsoft Edge, Opera for example)

## Steps to install
1. Hit the big green `<> Code` button
2. Hit `Download ZIP`
3. Extract `downludio-main.zip` with WinRAR or similar
4. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser's URL bar
5. Hit the toggle (likely in the top right) to enable Developer mode
6. Hit the `Load unpacked` button that appears
7. Select the folder you downloaded containing `background.js`, `content.js` and `manifest.json`. Note that after you extracted the ZIP earlier, the folder containing these files might be inside another folder, potentially of the same name. Chrome will let you know if you have selected the wrong folder.
8. The extension should appear in your extension list. Keep developer mode on. You can turn it off whenever you want, but you will need to turn it back on if you want to use the extension again.

## Steps to use
1. Click Play on one of your audio creations so that it starts playing at the bottom of the screen. You can pause it if you want.
2. Go to your extensions and click the Downludio icon.
3. Your audio will begin to download. Note: the file will just be named `The%20Untitled.mp3`, it doesn't save the generation's name.
